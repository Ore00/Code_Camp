 * Create a function that looks through an array (first argument) and returns the first element in the array that passes a truth test (second argument).

Remember to use Read-Search-Ask if you get stuck. Try to pair program. Write your own code.

Here are some helpful links:

Array.prototype.filter()
findElement([1, 3, 5, 8, 9, 10], function(num) { return num % 2 === 0; }) should return 8.
findElement([1, 3, 5, 9], function(num) { return num % 2 === 0; }) should return undefined.
 */

function findElement(arr, func) {
  var filterArr = arr.filter(func);  
  var num = 0;
  return filterArr[num]; 
}

console.log(findElement([1, 3, 5, 8, 9,10], function(num){ return num % 2 === 0; }));
